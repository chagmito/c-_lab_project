This project is a C++ console application that calculates and analyzes the annual electricity consumption and costs of a house with multiple households. It is implemented using object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic memory management, and file I/O.

Features

Manage a house with multiple households

Add different types of devices:

      Immobile consumers (e.g. TV, fridge, appliances with standby power)

      Mobile consumers (e.g. electric vehicles)

      Solar producers (photovoltaic systems)

      Flexible usage frequencies (daily, weekly, weekdays, weekends, once)
Automatic calculation of:

      Annual energy consumption (kWh)

      Annual energy costs (€)

      Solar energy production and savings
Linked-list based device management

Copy devices between households

Read/write complete house data from/to a file

Interactive menu-driven CLI

OOP Concepts Used

       Abstract base classes (Device)

       Inheritance (Consumer, Producer, Mobile, Immobile, Solar)

       Polymorphism (virtual functions)

       Dynamic memory allocation & destructors

       Operator overloading and static members

       File handling with streams
Purpose

       This project was created as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment in
